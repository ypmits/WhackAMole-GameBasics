# WhackAMole-GameBasics
*A Whack-a-mole game for Gamebasics*

## The Game:
- You have three lives.
- The game will popup moles from the underground on a regular basis.
- You have to quickly click the moles so they will return to the underground.
If you don't click fast enough, the moles will return underground and you will lose a life.
Optional: If you click the wrong mole (the spikey one), you will also lose a life.
- If you have no lives left the game will end.
