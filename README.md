# WhackAMole-GameBasics
*A Whack-a-mole game for Gamebasics*

## The Game:
- you have three lives
- you can play the game at three difficulties: Easy, Normal and Hard
- the game will popup moles from the underground on a regular basis
- you have to quickly click the 'moles' so they will return hiding underground
- If you don't click fast enough, the moles will automatically return underground but will lose a life<br>
**Optional gameplay (not implemented)**: If you click the wrong mole (maybe a spikey one), you will also lose a life
- If you have no lives left the game will end

## Development Setup:

- The UI is the biggest actor on stage here
  - Every button, textfield and most graphics can be found here
